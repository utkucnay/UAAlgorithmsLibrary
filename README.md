# UAAlgorithmsLibrary
C++ Algorithm Library For Unity. I use solve algorithm problems to this library and I want to implemented C# for my productivity. 
if you want to explain functions go the https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm .

This library not for production ready code just increase productivity because C# uses IEnumurable its like linked list and node is IEnumartor 
it's bad for performance. Don't use binary search because IEnumurable<T>.ElementAt is Big O(N) if you use binary search its will be O(N logN).
If you want just solving problem firstly and you don't think about performance, this library good for you. 

TL:DR
it's good for you, but not good for computer.
